"""Transform integration tests module.

This module contains comprehensive integration tests for the transform pipeline,
including end-to-end workflow validation, schema evolution testing, performance
optimization validation, and property-based robustness testing.

Test Categories:
- End-to-End Workflow: Complete pipeline from S3 event to catalog update
- Schema Evolution: Backward/forward compatibility and drift detection
- Data Quality: Advanced validation rules and quarantine handling
- Performance: File optimization, memory usage, and processing efficiency
- Property-Based: Robustness testing with arbitrary valid inputs

All tests follow TDD methodology and validate against transform specifications.
